# Go Cookbook

Hello friend! This cookbook is here to help you setup Go servers and agents
in an automated way. Currently, this repo is blank, but every project starts
from a humble beginning, does it not?

## Ideas

- How generic should we make this? All platforms or a handful?
- Test it with [test-kitchen](https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen)?
- Can we enable pipeline configuration via chef?

# Go Server

TODO, automate Go Server installation.

# Go Agent

TODO, automate Go Agent installation, and make sure it can point to the relevant server.
